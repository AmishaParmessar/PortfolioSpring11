          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this lab, I was instructed to write a program that outputs a joke on multiple lines using the print command and the escape character I had previously learned in lab 1.1.</h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>As a new learner to the python coding language, I was able to expand on my knowledge of using escape characters within the parameters of the strings inside of the print() command. In the console log, I was able to number my jokes and print the answer to the above joke. This was a fun lab because I was able to explore the commercial side of coding my favorite jokes which was very enjoyable in this lab. </h5>
