              <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to investigate the conditional statements within the code using my prior knowledge of operator signs. Also, I learned about selections in this code assignment. Overall, I met the requirements of this assignment and so my code did not run into errors.
        </h5>

              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this program, I learned how to predict and run the following codes and I learned how each condition is correctly outputted when the conditions are met. Additionally, the purpose of this program is to understand how conditional statements work and how indentation matters for print statements. When using conditions in the code the computer will understand that the print statement is inside of a conditional statement and will display the correct print statement.
