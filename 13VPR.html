      <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
    </br>
      <h5>In this lab, I was able to learn how to write a prediction of the given code and what it will do when it runs. 
      Also, I learned how variables are used and I learned what each line predicted. Most importantly, I learned about string concatenation, which means adding strings together.

      <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
    </br></h4>
      <h5>In this lab, I enjoyed learning how variables are used to assign a value. In this case it was a variable called firtName = “Andy” which demonstrates how a variable is assigned a string value called “Andy” and lastName = “Colley” was used as another variable which was assigned “Colley'' as the string value. With concatenation, the code was written as, print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + "."). This prints the string value "Hello Andy. Your full name is Andy Colley." 
      Overall, I enjoyed this project through learning about variables, assign and concatenate in my prediction. Next time, I would like to try new ways to concatenate this lab.
