          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I learned about new key terms called selection, condition, and branch in this assignment. My task was to predict and test the following codes. Many of the arithmetic operators in this assignment  reminded me of math operators which were similar in python. 
    </h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>This assignment was fairly easy because I was able to make an educated guess based on each of the sample code while making sure my code works properly. This assignment was written thoroughly to ensure what each line of code does. For example, this program doesnâ€™t allow for decimal digit values as it will output an error in the program. Next time, I would like to create a code that requires the user to stick to numbers between 0 and 10 to make sure the results output as expected.</h5>
