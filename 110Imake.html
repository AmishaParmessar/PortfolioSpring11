          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>
            Lots of websites use chatbots to interact with their customers. These chatbots are often very sophisticated and use AI to learn and adapt to the user. Our chat bot is going to be a bit simpler.

            The chatbot should work like this:

            Ask the user their name and store it in a variable.
            Greet the user by name.
            Ask the user three questions about themselves and store their responses in three different suitably named variables.
            Respond to each of the questions one by one, using the user’s name in the response.
            Output a summary of all of the user’s answers in a single sentence.

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>
            In this code assignment, I learned how to use efficiency in m y code by assigning a value to a variable and then using the print statement to concatenate the user’s input for their name with the given information they input as the program asks them simple questions. This task helped me build more practice on a chatbot assignment that will be later used in a larger project combining more knowledge gained from coding commands in code practices. Therefore, I was proud to create my very own simple chatbot and learn how to further practice my concatenation skills.
