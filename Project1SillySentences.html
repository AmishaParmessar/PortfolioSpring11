  <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
</br>
  <h5>In this assignment, I was instructed to write a program that would ask the user to input theri response to a series of questions/words asked. With this information, the computer would plug the responses before the user’s input into sentence structure creating silly sentences.</h5>
  <br>
  <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
</br></h4>
  <h5>In this code assignment, it was a fun way to generate a program that creates silly sentences for the user to input. My favorite part of this assignment was combining the user’s input by using my skills of concatenation to print the response from the user into sentences programmed by the computer. </h5>
