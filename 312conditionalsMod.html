              <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code, I was instructed to 
                Add a line of code asking the user to enter a third number
                Add IF/ELIF/ELSE statements to confirm whether the third number is bigger/smaller/the same as the first number and whether it is bigger/smaller/the same as the second number.

        </h5>

              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this program, I learned how to modify the following code and understand how the symbol operators work in the python coding language. This assignment was fairly easy to complete as it provided me with more practice to improve the conditional statements. IN the code, I predict that the program will print out "Number 3 is bigger than number 2" because the program is checking if number3 is greater than number1 and number3 is greater than number2. I checked this by running the program and it met my predictions and code.
