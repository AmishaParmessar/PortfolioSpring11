          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this project, I learned how to code and use the correct library to generate random colors while learning how to use parameters to create the sketch itself. Also, I learned how to define certain codes to format an animated line of colored dots which gave me the freedom to choose any color of my choice. Additionally, in this project, the importance of the new libraries was interesting as it was a new topic I learned in class and it was very intriguing to see the color dots move in the direction of the mouse. </h5>

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this project, I learned how to generate color dots with the necessary codes that I learned. My inspiration for the colors I used are from the colors of the autumn season which complimented the neutral shades in the animation of color dots. One thing that was surprising was the color dots following the mouse as I hover over. I am proud of the codes used to build the color dots animation and someone who is interested in animated work will enjoy learning from this project in the future. As well as, I would like to use more color dots and extend the height and the width of the screen in order to create a variety of colors which will help to complete the story of this project. </h5>
