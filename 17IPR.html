          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was able to comment on all lines of code in order to deepen my knowledge about the functionalities of the code and study the outputs and commands of certain lines of code.

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was able to learn more about how to predict and test the outcome of the written code. I was able to learn a new command called ‘name’ which is a variable that equals the command input and this allows the user to write in the input. I enjoyed writing many different names in the console log and the program would output “Hi (name) How are you today?” by printing the user’s input to print their name in the console log through concatenation.
