          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to study the following given code and write a prediction as to what it outputs. Basically, the general idea of this predict and run assignment was to understand each line of code in terms of them being inside or outside the loop. 

        </h5>

              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I learned how to understand â€˜while loops' and understand which line of code is inside of the loop and which line of code is outside of the loop. This assignment was fairly easy as this assignment helped me to review my previous work and improve on how loops work.
