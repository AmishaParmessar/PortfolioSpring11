          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this lab, I learned how to predict the following example codes, run the codes and investigate how the print statements, and strings work. </h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>This was the first lesson, where I learned how to code using the ‘print()’ command and this command is known as the output statement. Also, the string is the words "Hello World!" in print("Hello World!")  and the string is located inside of the parenthesis. Overall, this was an easy lab to complete as it allowed me to understand a simple command that I was able to practice using the python coding language.</h5>
