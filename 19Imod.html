          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to adapt the given code to: 
            Make it assign input into the 'name' variable. CHALLENGE - put a prompt in the input command to ask the user for their name.

            Combine lines 'Do you like programming' and answer = input so that the input has a prompt in it.

            Make the output on the next to last line include both the name and the answer variables.

            Add comments to explain what you have changed.

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I gained more practice on how to program the code that the input command to ask the user for their name. As a first time learner of python coding, I was proud of learning how to combine the lines of code using my knowledge of concatenation. However, the most challenging part of this code assignment was making the output on the next to last line include both the name and the answer variables.  However, throughout this challenge, I was proud of fixing each line of code. Next time, I would like to add comments that inform me of the purpose of each line of code.
