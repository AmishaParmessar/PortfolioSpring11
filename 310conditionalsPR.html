              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this program, I learned how to predict and run the following codes and I learned how each condition is correctly outputted when the conditions are met. The outcome of this assignment was a success as I was able to understand the requirements for conditional statements to be met in order to function and run properly. Therefore, I was proud of the skills I was able to practice when practicing this assignment.
