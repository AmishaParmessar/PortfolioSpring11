          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I learned how to investigate the given code. As well as, I learned how to identify how many output statements were used in the code, as well as the symbol of concatenation in the code, I learned which line(s) of code uses assignment and which symbols are used for assignment in code. Overall, I learned the purpose of the program by making sure I write my thoughts as comments so that I know the purpose of each line of code.

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code, I was able to expand my knowledge on the terms used to describe coding commands. For example, I learned that the ‘+’ symbol is used for concatenation. The ‘=’ symbol is called assignment in code. I enjoyed learning the various aspects of each line of code which gave me more knowledge on python code. One thing that I was proud of was being able to identify that the purpose of the empty print statement is to show the input in the parenthesis for the print command.
