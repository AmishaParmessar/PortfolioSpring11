          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to predict and test the given code. In this lab, I learned about new key terms, subroutine, call, and parameters which I incorporated in my code predictions. 

    </h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I learned how to define code commands and identify what each of the following code does when I click rn. This was a fairly easy assignment as I was able to review my previous skills and apply it to my predictions of 3.0 Functions assignment.  Also, numbers and concatenations were used in the second example, which was a skill I also gained in the first few labs. Overall, I was proud of being able to remember the code commands I had learned and apply it to my predictions.</h5>
