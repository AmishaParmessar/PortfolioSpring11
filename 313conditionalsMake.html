          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code, I was instructed to create a program that matches the requirements of #The user has to enter a number between 0 and 23
                #If the number is less than <  8 display a message saying "too early to get up"
                #If the number is less than <  12 display a message saying "Good morning"
                #If the number is less than < 14 display a message saying "Lunch time!"
                #If the number is less than < 18 display a message saying "Good afternoon"
                #If the number is equal to == 18 display a message saying "Tea Time"
                #If the number is less than < 19 display a message saying "Good evening"
                #If the number is less than < 22 display a message saying "Nearly bedtime"
                #If the number is == 23 display a message saying "Good night!"
                #Any other number is met with the response 'else' “Sorry, I don’t recognise that”</h5>
              <br>
              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this program, I learned how to create a "Time Reminder" that helped the user enter a number and the program checks if the following conditions are met or not and then decide what will be displayed in the console log based on what the number that the user entered. Also, this code taught me to practice my previous skills that were taught to me through a series of activities. To conclude, I was able to showcase my knowledge about conditionals that I have learned in this program make activity. Overall, this was also another easy assignment to complete as I was able to debug the many parts of my code when my code encountered an error. I am proud of my debugging skills and techniques incorporated to complete this assignment.
