          <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        </br>
          <h5>The idea of a chatbot is that it is a computer program designed to emulate human conversation. For this program, you will use if statements, user input, and random numbers to create a basic chatbot. 

            You have decided to design a fashion chatbot that helps people pick out their fashion preferences. Your bot can gauge what types of clothes and accessories the user might like.

            Instructions: 
            Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers depending on the answers the user inputs:

            - at least 6 questions

            - at least 3 if-elif-else statements

            - the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers

            Based on these criteria, some responses will be based on what the user types and some will be based on random numbers.

    </h5>

          <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this project, I learned to create a chatbot with the given requirements that align with my programming skills of creating a chatbot. This project was a challenge since there were multiple conditional statements that I had to program according to my creativity. As well as, the random module was the most difficult part of this project since this was not my strongest suit when I learned coding in python. However, I was proud of the outcome of this project as it was based on my creativity to base the chatbot by allowing the user to plan their day. Next time, I would like to receive more time to generate more questions for my chatbot and be able to receive feedback from my peers on ways I can improve on my chatbot. </h5>
