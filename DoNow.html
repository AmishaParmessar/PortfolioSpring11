      <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
    </br>
      <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to Write a program to:

        Write a program that asks for the user’s name and their favorite animal. The output should be: Hello Ada. Your favorite animal is the cat.
        Ask the user to enter a number, then print that number again 3 times.
        Asks the user to enter 3 test scores as integers. Then print out the average of the numbers. Hint: Addition and Division can be done like so: sumResult = firstNum + secondNum quotientResult = firstNum / second Num
        Asks the user to enter in 3 words, then prints the words in reverse order. If they enter: dog cat mouse It should output: mouse cat dog
        Ask the user to enter two integers. Draw a rectangle on the screen using ASCII art and label the length and width that the user enters. Find the area of the rectangle. So if they enter in 6 and 5 it should output: 5

      <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
    </br></h4>
      <h5>In this assignment, I created my program code to demonstrate the program asking the user for their name and asking their favorite animal. It also outputs a sentence structure with the user's name and their favorite animal. Based on this assignment, it was fun and enjoyable to create my program based on the given requirement and it was creative to learn the different challenges this task required which allowed me to expand my knowledge while challenging myself to coding in different difficulty levels. With the given instructions, this task seemed challenging but I was able to receive help from my peers to understand how to debug my code. However, I was proud of the outcome of the code. </h5>
