          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to investigate while loops and analyze the output each line of code performs in general and within the loop. 

        </h5>

              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I learned  how to understand and investigate parts of codes in the while loop.  Which helped to build on my prior work from the previous president and run assignments. Overall, I was proud of my skills   used to comment on the function of each line of code and break it down into my own words so that it is easier to understand whenever I look back at such codes.
