          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to assign my name and my favorite food to two separate variables with suitable names. After doing so, I created my very own code using a new variable and input with a string value. Additionally, I then output the content of the variables on two separate lines. The next level of this assignment was to output two sentences (not just the contents of the variables). The first with your name, the second with your favorite food. All together, I was instructed to output both pieces of information as part of the same sentence and make sure that I have spaces and punctuation in the correct places. 
    </h5>

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>I learned how to create a program using the skills I had previously learned. In addition, this code assignment was fun to program as the user’s input is based on their choice as they answer the presented question I have programmed. One challenging aspect of this code was the three different levels that I had to complete in order to concatenate all the information from the user’s input into sentences. I had to follow the simple, medium and complex levels to complete my code successfully which I was very proud of. As well as, I was proud of expanding my skills of concatenating my program carefully.
