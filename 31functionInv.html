          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to investigate functions within a code, as well as understanding the difference between functions and subroutines.
    </h5>

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>This code assignment teaches us how to investigate functions through variables and defining maths with return values. As well as, this activity teaches me the difference between subroutines and functions, as well as, parameters. One of the most challenging parts of this assignment was understanding the difference between functions and subroutines since they have similar aspects. As well as, the easiest part was identifying which functions had parameters. </h5>
