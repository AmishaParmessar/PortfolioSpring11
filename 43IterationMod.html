          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to modify codes within while loops. My teacher provided me with starter codes and I was instructed to adapt my code into
                Adapt the code to:

                Get user input into the number variable.
                Change the print statement so it outputs 'number' multiplied by 'counter' equals 'product'
                Make the counter increase by 2 every loop
                Add a line once the loop has finished to output 'The loop has finished'

        </h5>

              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this code activity, I learned how to use while loops and practice while loops to create a code where the user is able to enter a number value in the console log and the program will multiply the user's input with the even number from the counter's list with values below 13. Run the program to see an example of thisâ€¦
                Overall, I was able to learn more about while loops while improving my skills of identifying how each line of code works within or outside of the while loops. Considering the fact that while loops were not my greatest strengths when it came to iterations.
