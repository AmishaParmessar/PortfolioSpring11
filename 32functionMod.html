          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to make changes to the given code. The requirements were to adapt the code to:

            Rename the function so that it has a sensible name. Don't forget to rename it when it is called.
            Call the function with the argument 'Sweden'.
            Get the user to input a country. Store it in a variable. Call the function again with the variable as the parameter.

    </h5>
          <br>
          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I learned how to define functions using parameters. The easiest part of this assignment was running the code to understand which part of the code does what. There was no difficulty as this assignment was mostly modifying the code. </h5>
