      <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
    </br>
      <h5>In this project, I learned how to code and use the correct library to generate random colors while learning how to use parameters to create the sketch itself. Also, I learned how to define certain codes to format an animated line of colored dots which gave me the freedom to choose any color of my choice. Additionally, in this project, the importance of the new libraries was interesting as it was a new topic I learned in class and it was very intriguing to see the color dots move in the direction of the mouse. </h5>

      <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
    </br></h4>
      <h5>I enjoyed completing this code assignment because it gave me a deeper understanding of how to use math and arithmetic operations/functions to solve simple calculations in an efficient manner. This is an assignment that I was proud of because I was able to increase my skill level and learn the different commands by taking it to another level and performing calculations while making predictions of the given code. </h5>
