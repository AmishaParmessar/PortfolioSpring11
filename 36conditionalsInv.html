          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code, I was instructed to investigate the following code and to make sure it runs without any errors. For example, I had to modify the conditional statements to match with the input of the userâ€™s guess. I incorporated the '<' means that the number is less than the guess and the '>' means that the number is greater than the guess.
    </h5>

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this code, I learned about conditionals and how to investigate the conditions to test my predictions and understand what happens. This was a fun assignment because I was able to use this as a fun game with my friends and tell them to guess and input a number between 1 and 10 and see if it matches with the program. Next time, I would like to add  higher numbers to make this assignment code more challenging or take it to another level. Also,I was proud of debugging the code to make sure that my code runs smoothly without any errors.  </h5>
