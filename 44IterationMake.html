          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
            </br>
              <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to write a program that:
                Write a program that:

                Assigns the password 'abc123' to a variable with a sensible identifier.
                Asks the user to input their username and password and stores them in two new variables.
                Loops until the user enters the password 'abc123'.
                Outputs 'Login accepted' when the user does enter 'abc123'


        </h5>
              <br>
              <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
            </br></h4>
              <h5>In this code, I learned how to create a task that allows the user to enter a username and password, but the user has an unlimited amount of times to enter the password until they have guessed the correct password.
                However, I have encountered challenges within my code as I was given the task of also adding features to improve my program such as keeping count of how many tries the user takes to get the password right. Which I would have to use this number to output as part of the ‘Login successful’ message. Overall, I was proud of the program I created as it reflected my skills gained throughout the course of learning about iterations and being able to apply such skills to this program helped to bring out my skills.
