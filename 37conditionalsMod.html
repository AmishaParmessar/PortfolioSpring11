          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to adapt the given code so that:
            The user is asked at the end if they guessed correctly

            If they did, display a “Well done” message

            If they didn’t, display a “Never mind” message

            As well checking whether the answer is too high or too low, add a line that checks whether the guess is equal to the answer and if it isn’t, displays a “Bad luck” message

            Add comments to explain what you have changed.

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this replit assignment, I learned how to modify my code to check whether the guess value is equal to the answer and if it isn't then, the code will display "Bad luck". Also, I learned how to write an if-else statement to code this program and modify the program. Similar to my previous assignment within this unit,I was able to practice my skills of using conditionals to allow the user to enter a number while making a guess to see if that number matches with the program. This assignment was a fun way to learn how to use operators within the code and output messages in the console log so that the user is aware if they guessed correctly or incorrectly. Next time, I would like to allow the user to enter a digit until they have guessed the number which will require me to increase the guessing number higher than 10 (originally between 1 and 10), this would allow the user to input their guesses until they have guessed correctly. But I enjoyed how this program gave the user feedback if their guess was too high or too low.  </h5>
