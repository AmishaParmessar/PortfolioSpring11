      <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
    </br>
      <h5>In this code assignment, I learned how to create modification to my code in order to adapt it to the given requirement which are to
        Make it assign input into the 'name' variable. CHALLENGE put a prompt in the input command to ask the user for their name.

        Combine lines 'Do you like programming' and answer = input so that the input has a prompt in it.

        Make the output on the next to last line include both the name and the answer variables.

        Add comments to explain what you have changed
</h5>

      <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
    </br></h4>
      <h5>In the given code assignment, I was proud of being able to debug the code correctly and making changes to the code in order to output the correct result. For instance, the skills of concatenation from my previous assignment and lab gave me the advantage to understand how to concatenate the products of two given variables with values inputted by the user. I was surprised to see my debugging skills come into play when I was able to fix the codes as taught and learn the correct arithmetic operators to understand how to use them correctly when programming calculations. However, I found it challenging to put a prompt in the input command to ask the user for their name while making sure I have typed the variable names correctly.</h5>
