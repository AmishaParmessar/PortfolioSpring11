          <h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4>
        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed create a test grader program that meets the following requirements of

            The program should allow the user to enter a test mark between 1 and 100
            If the number entered is too high or too low, a message should be displayed informing the user of this
            Create a variable called Fail
            If the test result is less than 40 they have FAILED - assign the value “Y” to your Fail variable
            If the test result is greater or equal to 40, it is a PASS - assign the value “N” to your Fail variable
            Check the value of Fail - if it is NOT EQUAL to “N” print a message saying “Retake required”

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>In this program, I learned how to compose a program called "Test Grader" and it taught the condition statements to use in order to check if the grade entered by the user met the following requirements. This assignment was difficult as I had to make sure each integer that the user inputs aligns with the correct output. It was difficult to complete the code, but my peer guided me step by step on how to grade the user’s by giving them a grade based on the following grade criteria of Under 40: A "U" grade
            40 - 59: A "C" grade
            69 - 79: A "B" grade
            80 or over: An "A" grade.
