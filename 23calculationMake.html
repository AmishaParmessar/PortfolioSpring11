        </br>
          <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle

            Get input for height & width. Convert to integers and store in variables

            Calculate the area & store the result in the area variable

            Output the area variable (converted to string)

          <h4><b>REFLECTION</b></h4>
        </br></h4>
          <h5>Concatenating and using arthritic operators to perform simple calculators were easy. However, in this code assignment, I found it challenging to correctly calculate the area of the rectangle and store the result in the area variable. As well as, the visual image of creating the rectangle was somewhat difficult as I had trouble using the escape characters to demonstrate the rectangle with the correct calculations. After receiving help from my peers, I was able to understand my mistakes within the code and fix the code to make sure my rectable aligns with the area of the rectangle based on the numbers entered by the user.</h5>
