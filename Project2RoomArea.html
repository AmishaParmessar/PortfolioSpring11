      <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
    </br>
      <h5>For this lab, I was instructed to find the area of an irregularly shaped room with the shape as shown above. Ask the user to enter the values for sides A, B, C, D, and E and print out the total room area.Remember the formula for finding the area of a rectangle is length * width and the area of a right triangle is 0.5 * the base * height.
</h5>

      <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
    </br></h4>
      <h5>This code assignment was one of the most difficult coding projects because identifying the shapes' areas made this task more challenging. However, the easier method to complete this code was to create multiple shapes and then finding the area to help calculate the area more effectively. Therefore, there are many comments provided in this code to demonstrate what each line of code functions as and what it outputs. </h5>
