                </br>
                  <h5>In this code assignment, I was instructed to perform a series of calculations based on the arithmetic operators and symbols that are used in python coding. The outcome of this project was very interesting as it allowed the user to input an integer which was then performed by a calculation (+,-,/ x, etc).

                  <h5>In this assignment, I created my program code to demonstrate the program asking the user for their name and asking their favorite animal. It also outputs a sentence structure with the user's name and their favorite animal. Based on this assignment, it was fun and enjoyable to create my program based on the given requirement and it was creative to learn the different challenges this task required which allowed me to expand my knowledge while challenging myself to coding in different difficulty levels. With the given instructions, this task seemed challenging but I was able to receive help from my peers to understand how to debug my code. However, I was proud of the outcome of the code. </h5>
